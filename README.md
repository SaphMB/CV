## Sapphire Mason-Brown

A determined and passionate communications professional making a transition to the technology industry. After working in communications within the charity a public sectors, I'm training to become a developer at Maker's Academy, an intensive developer bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Communication

Through working in various communications roles over the last five years, I have become adept at making complex information clear and concise for the appropriate audience.

In my position at the London Youth Support Trust I led on the creating of the Trustâ€™s [online resource for start-up businesses](http://fromdreamingtodoing.co.uk). This translated complex information into a publication that was understandable and engaging even to those unfamiliar with the subject matter.

#### Organisation

Strong organisational skills have been central to my previous roles. As I have previously worked in roles where I was not based in the same office as my manager, managing my workload well was essential as I navigated the competing demands of work from other staff, everyday reactionary activity and long-term project work.

#### Working with stakeholders

Whilst working in the charity and public sector, I worked closely with a range of stakeholders including local councils, local councillors,  board members and senior management teams.
