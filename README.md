Former communications professional turned developer. After gaining valuable experience working within the charity and public sectors, I trained to become a developer at Makers Academy, an intensive developer bootcamp. I'm particularly interested in technology for good, combining my experience in the charity sector with my enjoyment of problem solving.

## Skills

#### Communication

Through working in various communications roles over the last five years, I have become adept at making complex information clear and concise for the appropriate audience. In my position at the London Youth Support Trust I led on the creation of the Trustâ€™s online resource for start-up businesses, translating complex information into an easy-to-understand guide.

As a communications lead, I also worked across teams to inform other parts of the organisation about projects I was working on and share knowledge. I have also improved my ability to speak about technical concepts by [blogging](https://medium.com/@saphmb) and coaching people new to coding.

#### Independent Learning

Throughout my studies, I honed my ability to work independently. My masters in particular in had very few contact hours with my diligently working on my dissertation using a research methodology I had never used before. This skill was further honed during my time at Makers Academy with my taking the lead on my own learning of key programming concepts.

#### Problem Solving

Whilst working in the charity sector, I was tasked with making an impact in the face of budgetary constraints. This meant that I regularly came up with creative ways to raise the profile of different organisations.

#### Working with stakeholders

During my time in the charity and public sector, I worked closely with a range of stakeholders including local councils, local councillors,  board members and senior management teams to meet shared goals.
